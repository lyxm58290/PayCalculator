# Payper Plan

## Personal Project

As a part-time tuition teacher and full-time university student, I often struggled to keep track of student lesson records — with frequent rescheduling, last-minute cancellations, and changing lesson timings. Managing all these while juggling schoolwork made monthly pay calculations a real hassle.

This personal project was created to help others like me — students who tutor on the side — track lessons and calculate monthly pay automatically and fuss-free.

#### What this project uses:
- Telegram Bot (set up via @BotFather)
- Google Sheets (to store and organize all lesson data)
- Google Apps Script

Whether you're tutoring one student or ten, this bot helps you stay organized, focus on teaching, and let automation handle the rest.
