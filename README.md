# 📝Payper Plan

## Personal Project

As a part-time tuition teacher and full-time university student, I often struggled to keep track of student lesson records — with frequent rescheduling, last-minute cancellations, and changing lesson timings. Managing all these while juggling schoolwork made monthly pay calculations a real hassle.

This personal project was created to help others like me — students who tutor on the side — track lessons and calculate monthly pay automatically and fuss-free. 💻

#### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- Google Apps Script – Backend logic and Telegram integration
- Google Sheets – Data storage for student records
- Telegram Bot API – Chat interface with inline conversation handling

#### ✅ Features:
- Add new students and automatically create dedicated sheets for their records
- Log lesson details: date, start & end time, hours, rate, total
- Automatically calculate hours and monthly earnings
- Summarize payments by student or by month
- Simple conversational flow using Telegram commands
- Lightweight and free to run (using Google’s infrastructure)

Whether you're tutoring one student or ten, this bot helps you stay organized, focus on teaching, and let automation handle the rest.
